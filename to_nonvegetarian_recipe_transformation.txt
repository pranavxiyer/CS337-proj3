Ingredients:

- 3 tablespoons salt
- 1 pound chicken
- 1 pound elbow macaroni
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 5 cups milk
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 1 pinch nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 pound Cheddar cheese, freshly grated
- 1 cup French fried onions

Directions:

Step 1: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Step 2: Bring 3 quarts of generously salted water to a boil on high heat.
Step 3: Add chicken and cook until they just start to get tender, but they are not soft, about 4 minutes.
Step 4: Remove with a hand strainer to a bowl; set aside until cool enough to handle.
Step 5: Cut into 1-inch pieces and reserve.
Step 6: Add elbow macaroni to the boiling chicken water, and cook 1 minute less than package directions, about 8 minutes.
Step 7: Transfer into a colander, and let drain for 1 minute, then transfer into a large bowl.
Step 8: For best results, make cheese sauce while pasta is cooking: melt butter over medium heat.
Step 9: Whisk in flour, and cook for a few minutes to take raw flavor away from the flour.
Step 10: Add cold milk all at once, and whisk to combine.
Step 11: Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a simmer and thickens (heat can be raised to medium-high to save time, if you stir constantly).
Step 12: While sauce is thickening, stir in salt, cayenne, thyme, pepper, nutmeg, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.
Step 13: Once mixture is thick, turn off heat and stir in cheese until melted.
Step 14: Add green chicken to hot, drained macaroni, pour in cheese sauce, and mix to combine evenly.
Step 15: Transfer into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Step 16: Place on a sheet pan to catch any drips.
Step 17: Scatter surface evenly with fried onions, and press them lightly into the surface with your fingertips.
Step 18: Bake in the preheated oven until mac and cheese is hot, and the top is browned, about 30 minutes.
Step 19: Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
