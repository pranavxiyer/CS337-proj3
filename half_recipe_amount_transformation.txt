Ingredients:

- 0.875 cups all-purpose flour divided
- 0.375 cup warm water divided
- 0.5 tablespoon dry active  yeast
- 0.5 teaspoon white sugar
- 1.0 tablespoons white sugar
- 0.5 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 0.125 teaspoon  salt
- 0.25 teaspoon  baking powder

Directions:

Step 1: Gather all ingredients.
Step 2: Mix together 0.125 cups flour, 0.125 cups warm water, yeast, and 0.5 teaspoons sugar in a large bowl.
Step 3: Allow to sit for 30 minutes.
Step 4: Mix in remaining 0.75 cups flour, remaining 0.25 cups warm water, 1 tablespoons sugar, vegetable oil, and salt.
Step 5: Knead until dough is smooth and elastic.
Step 6: Transfer to a greased bowl, roll to coat with oil, and let sit until tripled in size, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
Step 7: Punch down dough and spread out on a floured board.
Step 8: Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface of dough; knead for 5 minutes.
Step 9: Divide dough in half; set aside one half in a covered bowl.
Step 10: Divide remaining half into 12 equal pieces.
Step 11: Shape each into a ball; transfer each ball to a small square of waxed paper with the smooth surface facing up.
Step 12: Repeat portioning and shaping with remaining dough half.
Step 13: Cover all 24 dough balls and let sit until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Step 14: Bring some water to a boil in a wok, then reduce heat to medium and keep water at a low boil.
Step 15: Place the steam plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok, leaving at least 2 inches of space between the plate and the wok.
Step 16: Working in batches, place buns on waxed paper squares onto the steam plate, leaving 1 to 2 inches between buns.
Step 17: Cover and steam buns for 15 minutes.
Step 18: Carefully remove the lid, so condensation doesn't drip onto buns.
Step 19: Continue steaming remaining buns until all are cooked.
